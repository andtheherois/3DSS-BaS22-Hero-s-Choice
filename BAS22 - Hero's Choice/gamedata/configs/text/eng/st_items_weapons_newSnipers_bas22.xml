		<text>Modified version of the German WWII sniper rifle Mauser Karabiner 98k - another work of the Forester, known for his love for the restoration and modernization of old captured weapons of the WWII era. The original wooden stock has been slightly lightened; a handguard is installed on its front part, allowing the installation of an additional night sight. The rifle is equipped with an excellent sniper scope manufactured by March, Japan. According to the Forester, this rifle is more suitable for hunting intruders in the Red Forest than mutants.\n
